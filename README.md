## Overview
This is a side project for us (Paperfly) to get us started to be familiar with Android application development.

The idea is a blend of WhatsApp, Eventbrite and Google Calendar, but on a smaller scale and target audience, specifically, your friends and family.

## Implemented features
1. Start a quick event* with 2 taps (3 if you count opening the app as one)
2. Create groups with your friends
3. Start an event with your friends or a group

*Quick events are events that are planned ahead by the user, that is repeatable and reusable, like a template, e.g. basketball night every Friday
